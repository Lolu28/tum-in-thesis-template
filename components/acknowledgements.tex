Hereby, I would like to express my very great appreciation to all the people that helped me creating this thesis.

I would like to especially thank my first supervisor Dejan Pangercic for all the help I received during the last two years. Without his supervision, advice and help in work and non-work related topics this thesis would not have been possible. I would also like to thank my second supervisor J{\"u}rgen Strum for his help and willingness to resolve all my doubts and issues regarding this work. In addition, I thank my advisor Prof. Daniel Cremers for giving me the opportunity to write this thesis at his chair and for being very supportive during this process.

I would like to express my gratitude towards the team at Robert Bosch RTC in Palo Alto. Working in such an amazing team hugely contributed to this thesis. I thank my direct supervisor Sarah Osentoski for her constant support in writing this thesis. I would also like to thank other team members: Fadri, Matthias, Kai, Andi, Raph, Phil, Jan, David, Ben and all my other colleagues for a great working atmosphere and extremely competitive foosball games throughout my internship.

I want to point out my former advisor Prof. Michael Beetz for giving me the opportunity to work on projects that I am passionate about as well as the DAAD organization for enabling me to conduct my research in Germany without stressing about funding issues.

I wish to express my gratitude to my beloved family for their understanding and support, through the duration of my studies.

Special thanks are due to my best friend and work colleague Ross, who not only spent countless hours correcting my written English, but also was a great trip companion, research partner and accomplice.

I am also very grateful to Briana, Megha, Stephanie, Chet and Max for spending their free time correcting my English, hugely improving this thesis. 


Everyone that I did not mention explicitly should still feel thanked deeply, even if
just for providing pleasant conversation.
Thank you all!

My last thought goes towards Ola. I would like to thank you for always helping me putting the pieces together and being able to stay with me during stressful times. I can only imagine how hard it was for you which makes me love you even more.

%First off, I thank my parents and my sister Maresa for supporting me throughout

%Many in the robotics group have contributed to the success of this work. I would
%like to point out Kai and Phil for their support with hardware and Fadri among
%many things for this help with motion capture and data recording as well as valuable
%comments on my writings. Johannes has my special gratitude for waiting for me on
%countless evenings when that one bug just would not fix. Ben, Sarah, Tom, Tobi,
%Andi, Suresh and all the other interns from various groups were not only great office
%colleagues, but also excellent foosball opponents and weekend-trip companions. I
%thank Kurt, Hauke and Stefan, and all other discussion partners for sharing their

%Everyone that is not explicitly mentioned should still feel thanked deeply, even if
%just for providing pleasant recreation in form of a coffee-chat.
%Thank you all!
%My last thought goes towards Theresa, not only for enduring my bad moods at
%stressful times, but simply being the great Angel, M.D. she is.
